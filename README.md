# Git_Clone
This repository contains a video demo of the git clone that I made.

The following commands are implemented:

- init
- add
- commit
- rm
- log
- status
- checkout
- branch
- rm-branch
- reset
- merge

This was a class project of mine and was created completely from scratch with no starter code. Unfortunately, I cannot show the code that I wrote in this public repository because future students might come across it.
